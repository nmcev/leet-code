# Description:  
* having a number you need to select if it Odd or Even based on the sum of  thier number . <br>

* if ***the sum of the odd  numbers*** is greater than ***the sum of the even numbers*** then return **'odd'** 🔷.<br>

* and if ***the sum of the even numbers*** is greater than ***the sum of the odd numbers*** then return **'even'** 🔶.<br>

* and if ***the sum of odd number*** is equal to the sum of the even numbers then return **'equal'** 🟩. <br>
```javascript 
num = 4563;
result = 'even';
//explain : for even numbers => (4+6 = 10 ) and odd numbers => (5+3 = 8) so 10 greater than 8 so the output is 'even'
```
``` javascript
input = 3524
output = 'odd';
```
``` javascript
input = 54780;
output = 'equal';
```
