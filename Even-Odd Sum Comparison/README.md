# Description: 
having a number you need to select if it ODD or EVEN based on the sum of  thier number 

`num = 4563; <br>
result = even<br>
explain : for even numbers => (4+6 = 10 ) and odd numbers => (5+3 = 8) so 10 greater than 8 so the output is even`

## Note 

This is extra problem i got it from another website not [leetcode](http://leetcode.com) which i use in this repo ðŸ‘¾
